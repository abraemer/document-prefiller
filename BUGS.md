# Marker detection
When selecting the tests/data folder, the UI shows detected marker 'REPLACEME-TITLEMore' and 'REPLACEME-DATAdo' but should detect them as 'REPLACEME-TITLE' and 'REPLACEME-DATA'.

# Textboxes too small
The textboxes for entering the replacements are way to narrow. They occupy ~1/20 of the width of the row and there is a lot of unused space to their left.

# Replacement does not work
The file is only copied to the ouptput destination but no replacement operation takes place.

# Littering with .bak files
Every time when entering a value a new .replacement-values.json.bak is created. This is unnecessary. Just overwrite the existing .replacement-values.json directly without creating additional files.

# Enhancement
Open the output folder after performing the replacement.
